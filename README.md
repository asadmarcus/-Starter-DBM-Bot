<h1>Discord Bot Maker Starter Template</h1>
<p>A very simple starter kit for discord bot maker. Just clone the repository, navigate to it and open the project file with discord bot maker. Alternativly go to open project and navigate to where you cloned this repository</p>

<h2>Note: This was made to be used with the DBM software and no issues should be made if you are not using it</h2>
<p> The DBM software can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/682130/Discord_Bot_Maker/">here</a> // I do not own this software or take any credit for it</p>

<h3>Considor the following</h3>
<p>I did not make this software and in no way take credit for that. No way is this project associated with the developer Robert Borghese or an offcial DBM project.</p>

<h4>Credits</h4>
<p>Project made by <a href="https://develops.xenohub.xyz">Xeno Develops</a>;  Specificly by developer _iTrqPss#8258. The Xeno Develops discord server may be found <a href="https://discord.gg/x7GptKk">here</a>; Software made by Robert Borghese</p>

<h5>Uses</h5>
<p>This can be used for many things involving the DBM Software. This template was built to be edited and I hope this helps. An example of this would be just to have a quick startup when making a bot or another would be using this to learn how DBM works. Beta and beta mods are needed for this. To activate beta just go to Discord Bot Maker in your steam libary and right click>properties>betas>and change to beta. The latest beta mods can be found <a href="https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Maker-Mods/DBM-Mods">here</a> along with a installation tutorial.</p>
